* **Rem** is a simple tool that takes your webcam video feed and redraws it on an HTML canvas using emoji as pixels 😎!
* At any point you can decide to download either a photo or record a gif of your emojified video 💯.

* This project is made at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) 🐙, where I am currently learning programming.
